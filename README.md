# Customer-Segmentation-and-Decision-Tree-Analysis
This repository contains the notebook for customer segmentation using the K-Means algorithm, along with a decision tree model to improve the understanding of the identified segments.

Project Description:
The objective of this project is to apply advanced customer segmentation techniques, based on behavioral and demographic data, to create homogeneous groups that allow companies to personalize their marketing strategies. The dataset includes variables such as age, annual income, purchase frequency, customer satisfaction, and more. We used the elbow method to define the optimal number of clusters and applied K-Means to segment customers into seven groups.

Key Features:
Descriptive Analysis and Visualization: We explored the dataset variables through graphs that helped uncover behavioral patterns, such as the relationship between income and total spending, purchase frequency, and average spending per purchase.
Data Transformation: Numerical variables were standardized, and categorical variables were one-hot encoded to meet the K-Means algorithm requirements.
K-Means Segmentation: We identified 7 clusters and conducted an in-depth analysis of each, highlighting the key characteristics and behaviors of customers within each group.
Prediction with Decision Trees: A decision tree model was trained to predict customer group membership within the 7 clusters, enhancing the interpretation of the variables that most influence segmentation.
Model Improvements and Evaluation: Techniques such as undersampling and tree pruning were applied to mitigate overfitting issues and improve model interpretability.
This project is valuable for any company looking to optimize its marketing strategy by effectively segmenting its customer base, adjusting resources, and campaigns according to the different identified profiles.
